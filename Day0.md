## Day0: 29 Aug, 2018

Today, I have finally decided to begin my journey to the *#100DaysOfCode* Challenge.

I really hope I could complete this challenge without any breaks in between.

Some of my Targets to be achieved during this period, ie, I want to be better in these domains. Let's see how it goes:

[X] Angular
[X] Node
[X] Express
[X] Hyperledger Fabric
[X] Hyperledger Iroha
[X] Data Structures and Algorithms. 


Lot of things I know but I really hope I could learn and be a better programmer.
